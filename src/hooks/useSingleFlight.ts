/**
 * Wraps a function to single-flight invocations, using the latest args.
 *
 * Generates a function that behaves like the passed in function,
 * but only one execution runs at a time. If multiple calls are requested
 * before the current call has finished, it will use the latest arguments
 * for the next invocation.
 *
 * Note: some requests may never be made. If while a request is in-flight, N
 * requests are made, N-1 of them will never resolve or reject the promise they
 * returned. For most applications this is the desired behavior, but if you need
 * all calls to eventually resolve, you can modify this code. Some behavior you
 * could add, left as an exercise to the reader:
 *   1. Resolve with the previous result when a request is about to be dropped.
 *   2. Resolve all N requests with the result of the next request.
 *   3. Do not return anything, and use this as a fire-and-forget library only.
 *
 * @param fn - Function to be called, with only one request in flight at a time.
 * This must be a stable identifier, e.g. returned from useCallback.
 * @returns Function that can be called whenever, returning a promise that will
 * only resolve or throw if the underlying function gets called.
